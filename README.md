# Vanilla WoW talent calculator

My own approach of a World of Warcraft talent calculator using nextjs13. This project doesn't intend on profiting on Blizzard's game. Rather, I'm using it as a tool to learn new technologies and build something fun!

## How to run the project

First of all, make sure you've got node set up then run

```bash
npm i
```

ThenFirst, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
